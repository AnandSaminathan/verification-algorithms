# Verification Algorithms

A C++ library consisting of various algorithms to verify whether a model satisfies a given property. The library consists of various algorithms for verification of general models and also consists of a specialized algorithm for verification of petri-nets.

The algorithms implemented are 
- k Induction
- IC3 
- LTL Bounded Model Checking
- PetriNet Coverability Analysis
